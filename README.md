# Alcohol-Use-Disorder-prediction-
This project was carried out in Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences, India under the supervision of Dr. P Subha Hency Jose. 
The project aims to predict Alcohol Use Disorder early in people from their EEG signals using several ML techniques and LSTM. 
The dataset used for this project was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nnair25/Alcoholics.
